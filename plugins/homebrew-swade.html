<h2>Adding Homebrew Choices to Quilvyn's SWADE Rule Set</h2>

<p>
The SWADE rule set allows you to add homebrew choices to most of its
selections: powers, weapons, races, and so on. The entry dialog for each type
of choice includes fields for all the information particular to that type. For
most choices, the values to enter into the dialog can be determined by
comparing them to similar choices from the core rule book.
</p><p>
The input fields used to enter homebrew choices are similar to those used by
the Quilvyn editor&mdash;text fields, selection menus, checkboxes, etc. One
difference between the two is that you can enter multiple values into most text
boxes in the homebrew choices editor. For example, when entering a homebrew
weapon, you may want to enter multiple values in the Era text box. To do this,
separate the individual values by commas: Ancient,Medieval. If you ever need to
enter a single value that contains a comma into a text box, enclose the value
in quotes: "May create and mend magic weapons, armor, and shields".
</p><p>
Although the widest text boxes that Quilvyn uses show around 40 characters, you
can enter longer text values. Only 40 characters will show at once, but you can
use your arrow keys to move the cursor within the full text. Several examples
below show only the beginning portion of longer values entered into text boxes.

<a name="arcana"><h2>Arcanas</h2></a>
<img src='../Images/shb-arcana.jpg' alt='Homebrew Arcana'/>
</td><td>
<p>
The SWADE Quilvyn plugin uses the term <i>arcana</i> to indicate the various
types of arcane backgrounds a character might have&mdash;Magic, Miracles, Weird
Science, etc. When adding a homebrew arcana, Quilvyn provides a field that
allows you to enter the arcane skill associated with that arcana. If the arcana
limits practitioners to a subset of powers, you can also enter the list of 
powers available; otherwise, Quilvyn assumes that characters with this arcana
may make use of the full set.
</p><p>
The example shows the entry for a Necromancy arcana, which uses Occult as its
arcane skill and provides access to a limited set of powers.
</p>

<a name="armor"><h2>Armors</h2></a>
<img src='../Images/shb-armor.jpg' alt='Homebrew Armor'/>
</td><td>
<p>
When entering a homebrew armor type, Quilvyn provides fields that allow you to
enter the optional list of eras (Ancient, Medieval, Modern, and Future)
appropriate for the armor, the body areas that the armor covers (one or more of
arms, body (torso, arms, and legs), head, legs, and torso), the toughness bonus
provided by the armor, the minimum strength required to wear it, and the
armor's weight.
</p><p>
</p>
The example shows the entry for Brigandine armor&mdash;a jacket riveted with
metal plates.

<a name="concept"><h2>Concepts</h2></a>
</td></tr><tr><td>
<img src='../Images/shb-concept.jpg' alt='Homebrew Concept'/>
</td><td>
<p>
For homebrew concepts, Quilvyn provides fields that allow you to enter the most
important attributes, skills, and/or edges for characters built around that
concept. Quilvyn uses these values when randomly determining information for
the character; it will choose the items listed as important to the character
concept more often than other alternatives.
</p><p>
The example shows the entry for a Scavenger concept. It places high value on
the Common Knowledge and Repair skills, both of which are linked to Smarts.
</p>

<hr style="width:75%"/><br/>
<img src='../Images/shb-edge-feature.jpg' alt='Homebrew Edge'/>
</td><td>
<p>
For homebrew edges, Quilvyn displays fields to note the edge type and any
requirements that must be met to select it. Quilvyn allows you to specify two
kinds of requirements for an edge. The Prerequisite box lists any requirements
that must be met to select the edge; Quilvyn generates a validation error if
the edge is selected for a character who does not meet these requirements. The
Implies box lists any requirements that, while not strictly required, make the
edge useless if not met. For example, although the rules don't require it,
the Ace edge from the SWADE rules is likely to be useless to a character that
lacks the Boating, Driving, and Piloting skills. Quilvyn will generate a
validation warning if the Implies requirements are not met. When specified, the
Prerequisite and Implies fields will normally contain references to character
attributes; see the discussion of
<a href="#attrs">using character attributes</a> for how to include these. The
effects of an edge are described separately in a feature with the same name.
</p><p>
The example shows the entry for a combat edge named Flail Expert. The
Prerequisite box notes that it requires at least four advances (i.e., a rank of
seasoned or higher), and the Implies box notes that the edge is useless unless
the character possesses a flail. The example also shows the corresponding
feature that describes the effect of selecting the Flail Expert edge.

<a name="era"><h2>Eras</h2></a>
<img src='../Images/shb-era.jpg' alt='Homebrew Era'/>
</td><td>
<p>
Adding a homebrew era requires only specifying the name, although you will
likely want to also add weapons, and perhaps armor and skills, that are
particular to that era.
</p><p>
The example shows the entry for the Victorian era, which might be useful when
running a game based on Jules Verne's novels.
</p>

<tr><td colspan="2"><hr/></td></tr>
<tr><td>
<a name="feature"><h2>Features</h2></a>
<img src='../Images/shb-feature.jpg' alt='Homebrew Feature'/>
</td><td>
<p>
In Quilvyn, <i>features</i> describe the effects of edges, hindrances, and
racial abilities. When adding a homebrew feature, enter the section of the
character sheet (one of arcana, attribute, combat, description, feature, or
skill) where the note for the feature should appear, then enter the note text.
You can enter multiple sections and notes, but the number of sections entered
must equal the number of notes. Feature notes can both reference and modify
character attributes; see the discussion of
<a href="#attrs">using character attributes</a> for how to do this.
</p><p>
The example shows the entry for a feature named Glib with a note that appears
in the skill section of the character sheet. It adds 1 to the character's
Performance and Persuasion skills.
</p>

<img src='../Images/shb-hindrance-feature.jpg' alt='Homebrew Hindrance'/>
</td><td>
<p>
Adding a homebrew hindrance requires only specifying the name and the severity
(Major or Minor). By convention, Quilvyn adds a plus sign to the end of names
of major hindrances (so, "One Arm+"), but there's no requirement that you
follow this with homebrew hindrances. Although none of the hindrances from the
core rule book have prerequisites that must be met, Quilvyn allows you to add
them to homebrew hindrances. You could, for example, restrict certain homebrew
hindrances to characters of a specific race or concept.
</p><p>
The example shows the entry for a minor hindrance named Gullible, along with
the corresponding feature that describes its effects.

<a name="power"><h2>Powers</h2></a>
</td></tr><tr><td>
<img src='../Images/shb-power.jpg' alt='Homebrew Power'/>
</td><td>
<p>
When adding a homebrew power, Quilvyn displays fields that allow you to enter
the minimum number of advances (i.e., rank) needed to use the power, the number
of power points expended when using it, its maximum range, the description of
its effects, and any power-specific modifiers that can be applied.
</p><p>
The example shows the entry for the a power named <i>Borrow Trait</i>, which is
available to seasoned characters and costs 2 power points to cast, plus an
additional 2 power points for multiple traits.

<a name="race"><h2>Races</h2></a>
<img src='../Images/shb-race.jpg' alt='Homebrew Race'/>
</td><td>
<p>
For homebrew races, Quilvyn provides a field for listing the racial abilities
associated with the race. Quilvyn also allows you to specify prerequisites for
homebrew races; for example, you might want to define a race that has a minimum
strength requirement.
</p><p>
The example shows the entry for the Celestial race, taken from the ancestries
in the SWADE Fantasy Companion.

<a name="shield"><h2>Shields</h2></a>
</td></tr><tr><td>
<img src='../Images/shb-shield.jpg' alt='Homebrew Shield'/>
</td><td>
<p>
When adding a homebrew shield, Quilvyn provides fields for entering the
optional list of eras appropriate for the shield, the Parry and Cover values it
provides, the minimum strength required to use it, and its weight.
</p><p>
The example shows the entry for a medium steel shield, which provides a greater
parry value than a standard medium shield at the cost of requiring a higher
strength to use it.
</p>

<tr><td colspan="2"><hr/></td></tr>
<tr><td>
<a name="skill"><h2>Skills</h2></a>
<img src='../Images/shb-skill.jpg' alt='Homebrew Skill'/>
</td><td>
<p>
When adding a homebrew skill, Quilvyn displays fields for the optional list of
eras appropriate for the skill and for the skill's linked attribute. You can
also check the "Core" box to indicate that this homebrew skill is a core skill,
which means that all characters will automatically have a d4 in the skill.
</p><p>
The example shows the entry for an Appraise skill, linked to Smarts.
</p>
</td></tr>

<tr><td colspan="2"><hr/></td></tr>
<tr><td>
<a name="weapon"><h2>Weapons</h2></a>
<img src='../Images/shb-weapon.jpg' alt='Homebrew Weapon'/>
</td><td>
<p>
When adding a homebrew weapon, Quilvyn displays fields that allow you to enter
the optional list of eras appropriate for the weapon, its primary category
(Unarmed, One-Handed, Two-Handed, or Ranged), the damage it inflicts, the
minimum strength required to use it effectively, its weight, and any armor
piercing, range, rate of fire, and parry attributes it might have.
</p><p>
The example shows the entry for a boomerang, a ranged weapon with a 5" (10
yard) range that inflicts Str+d4 damage.
